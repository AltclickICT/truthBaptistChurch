        <div style="padding:3px;"><p>On 25 May 2017 Brenda and I left the US for Nigeria where Missionary Mark Holmes and I would be hosting two church planting conferences. Nigeria has close to 100 million Muslims. We have now begun to equip God's people with the means to accomplish this great task of getting the Gospel to Muslims, and by His grace and with his power, the task will be accomplished.</p></div>

    Some may wonder if it is possible to win many Muslim’s to Christ. I believe that the Great Commission extends to all men including Muslims. With the free flow of information and the many Christian visitors around the world, many Muslims are curious as to what Christianity is really all about. For the first time in years they are open and beginning to question their belief system. I am thrilled to report that this great harvest has already begun and should only increase in the days ahead.

    In Nigeria the Fulani tribe seems to be the most difficult to reach. They are nomadic, traveling anywhere they can find grass for their herds; many are uneducated, and if a Fulani leaves the Muslim religion, he faces many challenges. Often he is left with no money, no personal possessions, and no education whereby he can earn a living and support his family, if they have escaped with him.  His public stand for Christ costs him everything. As of this writing 9 Fulani families have received Christ, 4 have made their decision public and fled to Abuja where they live in desperate conditions, cared for by members of Truth Baptist church [pictured with Fulani on platform].  The other 5 families have not made their decision known as they have no place to go.

    Your investment in Nigeria is paying great dividends.  We are beginning to see an impact throughout the country, and the pace is quickening.  Often, when a Muslim family [pictured] receives Christ, they want other family members to hear what they have heard.  They naturally recruit new prospects for the Gospel.  I believe that what we are seeing is the first fruits of one of the greatest harvests of souls that we have ever witnessed.

    If we are serious about winning Muslims to Christ then we must be prepared to help them face the challenges which come with such a decision.  Brother Holmes and I believe that if the harvest of souls that is just now beginning among the Fulani people is to continue and grow then it is imperative that we provide them with a safe place to live while they transition into a new life.  It is our goal to provide them with a City of Refuge.  To make this goal a reality we have already purchase 6 plots of land and erected two housing structures that can temporarily provide accommodations for 20 families. The remaining structures needed are a church auditorium and also a building for toilets/kitchen. Money for fencing and a deep water well has already been raised.

    We have all expressed concern for the problem of Muslim extremism. We have said that something must be done. We are doing something that will work, will turn the tide, but we can’t do it without your help.   We remaining cost for this project, including giving them a means of support will be $25,000.  We already have a pastor who has started a church in the resettlement area [Pastor Timothy Gideon pictured].  Now like Cornelius, they wait.  They wait for us to do what they cannot do.  They will win the Muslims but they need us to partner with them.  What will you do?  My wife and I go, twice a year to help and train.  Will you pray for God’s power and leading?  Will you share this project with others so we can accomplish more?  Will you give sacrificially to make this City of Refuge a reality?  If you are a pastor will you lead your church to have a major part in this project?

            In 44 years of full time ministry I have never seen an opportunity like this, an opportunity to influence an entire nation of nearly 200 million people.  I love you and want to thank you in advance for partnering with Brother Holmes, me, and our Nigerian brothers and sisters.  Thank you for your faithful monthly support that makes this all possible [progress so far].

        <p style="padding:5px;">The Nigerian effort to win Muslims to Christ is bearing fruit.  A total of nine families from the Fulani tribe have received Christ as of this writing.  Five families have made their decision known and have fled to Abuja the only city in Nigeria where they can live in safety, as the Fulani tribesmen will not attempt to harm them there.  These five families were staying in an abandoned chicken farm.  Some twenty people, including ten babies and children, lived in an open- air building, and two 10X10 rooms. They cooked on open fires and drank from a polluted 20” deep well, fed by the members of Truth Baptist Church. This past week, I was informed that another family is ready to make their decision to receive Christ public, but once they do, they must flee to Abuja.  My friend, these dear brothers and sisters in Christ have nothing once they leave.  No personal belongings, no home, no money, no usable trade with which to support their families, but they have Christ and they have us.</p>

        <p style="padding:5px;">Muslims are being saved but we must help those who will take a stand for Christ.  Brother Holmes, I, and the Nigerian Christians are doing our part. Will you help us to take the next step and build a transition center for the Fulani refuges, a City of Refuge [2 housing structures with visiting missionaries].  For this to further become a reality we must raise the funds for a bath house and church auditorium.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p style="padding:5px;">For the cost of a new car we can help Fulani Christian families transition to a new life in Christ where they can become active, winning other Muslims to Christ.  Something is being done and it is working.  Will you join with Brother Holmes and me to make the City of Refuge a reality?  We need your help today.  Please send whatever you can to Global Outreach, P.O. Box 906, Springboro, Ohio 45066.  On the memo line put “City of Refuge”.</p>
        <p style="padding:5px;">Are we going to be like the Priest and the Levite in the parable of the good Samaritan, we see the problem but do nothing to help?  Let us step up and be like the Good Samaritan and help those in dire need.  Thank you in advance for your support of these wonderful people.</p>
