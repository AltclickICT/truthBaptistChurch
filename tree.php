    <h3>Tree of Life</h3>
</center>   
<p>
    Since 2001, two years before Sabrina and I started deputation, Patricia Hamburg has been faithfully serving in Nigeria. Affectionately called “Nana,” she now diligently teaches and tutors English courses in our seminary, devotedly cares for the single ladies class in our church, regularly participates in soul-winning and visitation, and willingly conducts seminars and workshops for our families. We are highly recommending her to our ministry supporters and praying friends and asking you to consider supporting her personally through her sending church or helping with one of her outreach travels through us.
