    Please allow me with this letter, as the pastor of Truth Baptist Church, to introduce to you to Providence Baptist College and Seminary, founded in August 2009. We would like to make every pastor aware of our  training institution where you may send your people who want to serve God in the ministry. God has privileged us to establish such a school where our goal is the planting of independent Baptist churches all through Nigeria.
    </p>
    <p>
    Providence Baptist College and Seminary (PBC&S) is a ministry of Truth Baptist Church and Fundamental Baptist Ministries International (our mission board).  Students at PBC&S, during their scholastic training, will be involved in the ministries of Truth Baptist Church which include the following: church services, soul-winning, Bible institute, choir and music groups, children’s ministries, bus ministry, fellowship groups, school of the prophets, Bible clubs, school programs, and village outreach. Those in the seminary will also benefit from the annual meetings at our church: Soul-Winning & Leadership Conference, Missions Conference, Revival Meeting, and Youth Camp.
    </p>
    <p>
    As the administrator of Providence, I also want to assure you that my desire is for us to partner together in your church members’ training. We will strive to maintain regular contact and a good relationship with each independent Baptist pastor who entrusts us with their people for the preparation of the ministry. Students will be encouraged to seek counsel and advice from their pastor. Yet, they will also have plenty of opportunities to work in other ministries on an internship basis and also at the completion of their seminary studies.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each prospective student will need to fill an application [2 pages included below] and also include a recommendation [included below the application] from the pastor of the independent Baptist church where he is a member; also, take a look at our full curriculum at the end of this page.  I look forward to hearing from you.
    </p>
