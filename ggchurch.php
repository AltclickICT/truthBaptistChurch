    It is with great joy that we welcome you to the ministry of Grace & Glory Baptist Church.  We are confident that our services will be a blessing to you, and our prayer is that we can encourage you during your visit.  Grace & Glory Baptist Church began on 31 May 2015 as an assembly that is founded upon the Word of God for the purpose of winning souls to Christ, exhorting the brethren, and pleasing our Saviour.

    We invite everyone to join our Bible classes for adults every Sunday by 9am in our church auditorium, with a preaching service immediately following. The children have their own classes during both hours, and our youth director, Pastor Adewale Adesina, teaches a single adults class every week.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the first Sunday of each month, we have an afternoon service (instead of an evening service) immediately after the morning preaching hour (and some light refreshments and brief fellowship). House Fellowships are conducted in Mabushi on the third Sunday Evening of each month by 5pm. The remaining Sunday Evening services are held at the venue: 2nd Sunday Lordâ€™s Supper and 4th Sunday Singspiration and Bible Study.</p>
    <p>
    For any assistance, you may call our missionary, Pastor Mark Holmes, who is at the church during our regular service times on Sundays by 9am and 5pm and is available for counseling. Pastor Adewale Adesina, can be reached at 0802 894  0144. The church's email address is gracegloryabuja@yahoo.com. We look forward to every opportunity that we may have to serve you.</p>
